* Leap : Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
* Reverse String : Reverse a string, for example: input: "cool" output: "looc".
* Nucleotide Count : Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
* Queen Attack : Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.
* Secret Handshake : Convert a number between 1 and 31 to a sequence of actions in the secret handshake.
* RNA Transcription : Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
* nucleotide Count : Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
* Hamming : Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.
* VisualPatterns : Draw some patterns with loops.
* Pascal Triangle : Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.
