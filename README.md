* Disjkstra Algorithm : is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph.
* Nth Prime : Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.
* Prime Factor : Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.
* Prime Numbers : print n prime numbers.
* Robot Simulator : The robots have three possible movements: turn right, turn left, advance.

* Allergies : Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.
* Amstrong Numbers : An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
* Atbash Cipher : Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.
* Binary : onvert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.

* Nucleotide Count : Given a string representing a DNA sequence, count how many of each nucleotide is present.
* Pangram : Determine if a sentence is a pangram.
* Pascal Triangle : Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.
* Perfect Number : Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for positive integers.
* Pop Count : count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number.
